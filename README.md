For Penn Spark application:

Thank you for visiting my repository! I finished developing my main productivity app a year ago and it's been in production mode since then. I decided to make some additions to a sister app I developed, which is a spaced repetition memory app called MemGrow (under the same domain to save costs, at [https://smartcalendar.us/memgrow](https://smartcalendar.us/memgrow)).
1. MemGrow is a memory app that uses flashcards. When you answer a card correctly, it waits longer before showing it again. If you get it wrong, it comes back sooner. My memory app has been used by many of my classmates during finals season to memorize formulas and concepts in courses like math, psychology, and physics. I have personally used it to learn 4000+ Chinese words.
2. The app includes components, animations, mobile responsiveness, API calls, database, classes and objects, linking frontend w/ backend, and deployment. Over the past week, my specific addition to the project was implementing a ChatGPT Model Context Protocol (MCP) action. This addition allowed ChatGPT to generate flashcards and send them directly to my app's API. Once generated, I could then select which flashcard set I wanted the new cards to be added to. An example use case I've been experimenting with is uploading lecture notes from my courses and generating flashcards based on new content.
3. I spent a total of ~100 hours on this project, and over the past week I spent around 3 hours.
